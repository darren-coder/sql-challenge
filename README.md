# sql-challenge

- This assignment was to create tables in pgAdmin 4 using postgreSQL and import data from csv files to those tables. Primary and Foreign keys were assigned for proper referencing. Queries were then created to collect specified information, using inner joins to combine columns from different tables. An ERD was made to show relationships between the tables.

- An image of the ERD, the schema for creating the tables, and the queries used to gather the information are included in the EmployeeSQL file.
